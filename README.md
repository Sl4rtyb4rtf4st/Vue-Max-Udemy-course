# Maximilian Vue Udemy course

In this repository I am trying to assemble a sort of extended cheat sheat for Vue where I can find all the funcamentals but also in part the nitty gritty of Vue as tought during the Vue Udemy course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller [link](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/).


## Assignments

I will also include the results of the assignments as completed by me


## Usage

Each folder has a package.json and a webpack config file so to view any of the projects in each folder and run the webpack dev server run the following commands. Obviously requires node to be installed.   

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
